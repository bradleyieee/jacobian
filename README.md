# Jacobian
Jacobian is an abstraction layer for configuing and utilizing a Raspberry PI's GPIO pinouts. 

# JacobianOS
This software, JacobianOS, is implemented on a Raspberry PI 3b at the lowest level above the hardware of
the Bradley IEEE self-driving RC car. It serves to decompose high
level vector input into two PWM signals and generate them using the PI system clock as well
as deliver the logic HIGH and LOW out of the GPIO pins. It is also an interface to communicate to the car via console commands and 
JacobianOS Routine Scripts (*.jors), which specify sequences of timed commands to translate the car.

# JacobianOS Routine Script (.jors)
Documentation coming soon.
